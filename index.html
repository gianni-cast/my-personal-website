    <h1>Steelers 2024 Draft Class</h1>
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>The Steelers have overhauled their qb room in free agency. They moved on from their former 1st round draft selection, Kenny Pickett, and have aquired Russell Wilson along with Justin Fields. Additionally they signed former Falcons head coach (2021-23), Arthur Smith, to be their new offensive cordinator for upcoming 2024 NFL season. The hope is to replicate the success he had with the run game as OC of the Titans (2019-20). The Steelers had one of the best rushing attacks towards the end of 2023 season with the "Thunder" and "Lightning" tag team of Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. The Steelers cleary prioritized their offensive line in this years draft as they added three new offensive lineman in addition to adding depth to other positions of need. Let's take a look at the 2024 Draft Class!</p>

        <p>
            The Steelers have now had two excellent drafts in back to back years under new genral mananger, Omar Khan. Four of these players will most likely be day one starters in September and should contribute immediately. Russell Wilson and Justin Fields will have the time and protection to make big time plays and win a lot of Football games. The AFC north is currently the toughest division in football and the Steelers have a legitamate chance to once again be known as the, "Kings in the North".
